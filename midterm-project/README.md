“Customer Churn” refers to the loss of customers. That is, if a customer or a client stops taking services from a company, it is said that he/she has churned.

Churn is intimately connected to a company’s performance. The more one learns about buyers’ behavior, the more money one can make. Analyzing customer churn also aids in finding and improving the shortcomings of services provided by the company.
